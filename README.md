# All Tax Back

## Overview
One Niche that I plan on targeting as a web developer is tax agents. For this reason I based this project off of alltaxback.ie. I redesigned 3 pages from this website (homepage, tax-refunds-rent-relief and apply-online). The idea behind this is to add to this project as I learn more skills from the Code Institute. Once the project is finished I will have a sample tax agent website. This will then be easy enough to slightly modify for when I get my first client.

## UX
The UX of this website is designed so that there is an obvious flow to guide the user through the website.

The flow of the website for a user who is interested in getting a tax refund is as follows.
1. Hero section - This is a full screen section which displays the compnaies logo and tagline. There is the an accreditation added to build an immediate sense of trust for users of the site. They will know that this tax agent is fully certified and experienced.
2. About Section - The next section is to explain a bit about the tax agent. As potential clients will be working with a single individual they will like to know a bit about that person. This also helps to build trust.
3. Services Section - This section explains the different services that the tax agent offers. This helps to explain to the visitor how the tax agent can help them.
4. Process Section - Now that we have built up trus and informed the user, we can show them how simple it is to get started with a 3 step process and a CTA to get them started.
5. Guarantee Section - If they are still not convinved at this point then we ease their minds with a No Refund No Feee guarantee and another CTA

## Current Features
Feature 1 - build trust and authority by displaying experience, accrediatations and offering a guarantee.
Feature 2 - Display relevant information to the visitor so they know what is being offered.
Feature 3 - Display the simplicity of signing up.
Feature 4 - allows users apply to the service by filling out the contact form

## Features Left to Implement
A digital signature is usually needed by tax agents to sign off on documents on the clients behalf

## Technologies Used
Bootstrap https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.4.1/css/bootstrap.min.css - this was used as it offers great ease of use and mobile responsiveness
Fontawesome https://kit.fontawesome.com/6cb8961edb.js - this was used to add icons to the site
JQuery & Javascript https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.4.1.slim.min.js & https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.4.1/js/bootstrap.min.js - this was used to add the clickable dropdown menu in the menu bar
HTML & CSS - Used to develop and design the website.

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.

Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
